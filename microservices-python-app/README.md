## Deploying a Python-based Microservice Application on AWS EKS

### Introduction

This document provides a step-by-step guide for deploying a Python-based microservice application on AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). The application comprises four major microservices: `auth-server`, `converter-module`, `database-server` (PostgreSQL and MongoDB), and `notification-server`.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Create an AWS Account:** If you do not have an AWS account, create one by following the steps [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/setting-up.html).

2. **Install Helm:** Helm is a Kubernetes package manager. Install Helm by following the instructions provided [here](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

3. **Python:** Ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

4. **AWS CLI:** Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) following the official [installation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).

5. **Install kubectl:** Install the latest stable version of `kubectl` on your system. You can find installation instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/).

6. **Databases:** Set up PostgreSQL and MongoDB for your application.

### High Level Flow of Application Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy your microservice application:

1. **MongoDB and PostgreSQL Setup:** Create databases and enable automatic connections to them.

2. **RabbitMQ Deployment:** Deploy RabbitMQ for message queuing, which is required for the `converter-module`.

3. **Create Queues in RabbitMQ:** Before deploying the `converter-module`, create two queues in RabbitMQ: `mp3` and `video`.

4. **Deploy Microservices:**
   - **auth-server:** Navigate to the `auth-server` manifest folder and apply the configuration.
   - **gateway-server:** Deploy the `gateway-server`.
   - **converter-module:** Deploy the `converter-module`. Make sure to provide your email and password in `converter/manifest/secret.yaml`.
   - **notification-server:** Configure email for notifications and two-factor authentication (2FA).


### MongoDB

To install MongoDB, set the database username and password in `values.yaml`, then navigate to the MongoDB Helm chart folder and run:

```
cd Helm_charts/MongoDB
helm install mongo .
```

Connect to the MongoDB instance using:

```
mongosh mongodb://<username>:<pwd>@<nodeip>:30005/mp3s?authSource=admin
```

### PostgreSQL

Set the database username and password in `values.yaml`. Install PostgreSQL from the PostgreSQL Helm chart folder and initialize it with the queries in `init.sql`. For PowerShell users:

```
cd ..
cd Postgres
helm install postgres .
```

Connect to the Postgres database and copy all the queries from the "init.sql" file.
```
psql 'postgres://<username>:<pwd>@<nodeip>:30003/authdb'
```

### RabbitMQ

Deploy RabbitMQ by running:

```
helm install rabbitmq .
```

Ensure you have created two queues in RabbitMQ named `mp3` and `video`. To create queues, visit `<nodeIp>:30004>` and use default username `guest` and password `guest`

**NOTE:** Ensure that all the necessary ports are open in the node security group.

### Apply the manifest file for each microservice:

- **Auth Service:**
  ```
  cd auth-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Gateway Service:**
  ```
  cd gateway-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Converter Service:**
  ```
  cd converter-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

- **Notification Service:**
  ```
  cd notification-service/manifest
  kubectl apply -f .
  ```

### Application Validation

After deploying the microservices, verify the status of all components by running:

```
kubectl get all
```

### Notification Configuration



For configuring email notifications and two-factor authentication (2FA), follow these steps:

1. Go to your Gmail account and click on your profile.

2. Click on "Manage Your Google Account."

3. Navigate to the "Security" tab on the left side panel.

4. Enable "2-Step Verification."

5. Search for the application-specific passwords. You will find it in the settings.

6. Click on "Other" and provide your name.

7. Click on "Generate" and copy the generated password.

8. Paste this generated password in `converter/manifest/secret.yaml` along with your email.

Run the application through the following API calls:

# API Definition

- **Login Endpoint**
  ```http request
  POST http://nodeIP:30002/login
  ```

  ```console
  curl -X POST http://nodeIP:30002/login -u <email>:<password>
  ``` 
  Expected output: success!

- **Upload Endpoint**
  ```http request
  POST http://nodeIP:30002/upload
  ```

  ```console
   curl -X POST -F 'file=@./video.mp4' -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>' http://nodeIP:30002/upload
  ``` 
  
  Check if you received the ID on your email.

- **Download Endpoint**
  ```http request
  GET http://nodeIP:30002/download?fid=<Generated file identifier>
  ```
  ```console
   curl --output video.mp3 -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer <JWT Token>' "http://nodeIP:30002/download?fid=<Generated fid>"
  ```
