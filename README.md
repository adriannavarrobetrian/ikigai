# Ikigai

## Introduction

Ikigai is a Japanese concept that means your ‘reason for being.’ ‘Iki’ in Japanese means ‘life,’ and ‘gai’ describes value or worth. Your ikigai is your life purpose or your bliss. It’s what brings you joy and inspires you to get out of bed every day.

The Westernised version of ikigai says you’ve found your dream career when your career includes these four qualities:

- What you love
- What you’re good at
- What you can be paid for
- What the world needs

This repo and all the other ones referenced here tries to encompass that philosophy and serve as a way for me to play/practice/learn/show everything related to the DevOps work I do.
